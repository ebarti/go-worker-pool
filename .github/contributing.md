## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to go-worker-pool](https://github.com/ebarti/go-worker-pool/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about 
[pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)).
I can always use more test coverage. Please make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

Thank you,

Eloi
